## Round goby's impact on fish community

## Introduction 

This repository compile an R script running a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) linking a community and
their potential predators. This is a flexible RDA worklow, which could be used to aim other goals. 

We provided raw data to realize a test run of the script. This dataset provide an analysis of the
before and after Round Goby invasion on St. Lawrence River littoral fish community.

This Github repository serve also as data and code sharing for this publication
