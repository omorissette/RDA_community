## Round goby's impact on fish community

## Introduction 

*This Github repository serve as data and code sharing for this publication*:

Morissette, O., Paradis, Y., Pouliot, R. and Lecomte F.,(**2018**) Spatio-temporal changes in littoral fish community structure along the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada) following round goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*) invasion Aquatic Invasions 13(4):501-512 DOI: [10.3391/ai.2018.13.4.08](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2018/AI_2018_Morissette_etal.pdf)

This repository also give an example of an R script running a Redundancy Analysis (RDA), *in this case*, linking a change in littoral fish community with the experimented change in their potential predator abundances. 
I intented this code to be a flexible RDA worklow, which could be used for other goals. 

We provided raw data to realize a test run the script. This dataset provide an analysis of the before and after Round Goby invasion on St. Lawrence River littoral fish community.

## Context of the data

Fish abundances were obtained from the RSI (*Réseau de Suivi Ichtyologique*), described in La Violette *et al.* 2003), a governmental fish survey conducted in the St. Lawrence River that characterizes the fish community at the end of the growing season (August to October).
The RSI sampling strategy was designed to cover both lentic and lotic habitats in all sectors along both shores of the St. Lawrence River. The deep navigation channel was excluded (see de la Chenelière *et al.* 2014). 
The RSI used two different gears according to the position of the sampling station (1) a standardized beach seine net (12.5 m long × 4 m deep and 3.2 mm stretched mesh) and (2) an array of two multimesh gillnets (60 m long × 1.8 m deep; eight panels of 25, 38, 51, 64, 76, 102, 127 and 152 mm stretched mesh)
